The survival of a\nmercenary warband relies more on the wit\nand experience of its captain, than on how\ngood a fighter he is. It’s all too common that\nan inexperienced captain will lead his men\ninto an ambush, or lead them on a long\njourney with no food or supplies. Being a\nsuccessful captain means that your men will\nfollow you to hell and back, and plenty of\ngold crowns and feasting. A captain that fails\nin his duty to keep his men alive and well fed\nwill at best find himself deserted and worst\nend up with a knife in his back.",
